## Technical Explanations
In this lab, we need to rewrite product-service in python then set up a RabbitMQ server on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) and deploy the order-service, product-service, and store-front  using Azure Web App Service and Azure Static Web Apps.

Each theses microservices are available on GitHub on their respective repositories.
Here below are the link for each microservice GitHub repository

- [Product-Service-rust.js](https://github.com/sopn0001/CST8915-Lab2-product-service)
- [Product-Service-python](https://github.com/sopn0001/CST8915-product-service-L3P)
- [Order-Service](https://github.com/sopn0001/CST8915-Lab2-order-service)
- [store-front](https://github.com/sopn0001/CST8915-Lab2-store-front)

Order-service, product-service, and store-front GitHub will integrate Azure Web App Service Deployment Center for automatic deployment. Environment variables for order-service and product-service will need to be configure in their respective Azure Web App Service. As per store-front, the environment variable on the .yaml.
